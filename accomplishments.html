    <td><p align="left">During  law school, I served as the President of the legal fraternity Phi Delta Phi and  also was elected as its representative to the Biannual National Convention in  Washington D.C.</p>
      <p align="left">While  in my last year of law school, I had the unique opportunity to be Deputy City  Prosecutor for the City of Albany, Oregon, under what was called the third year  appearance rule.  This allowed me to try  cases prior to graduation.  I handled  well over 100 bench trials and had two criminal jury trials prior to my  graduation from law school.</p>
      <p align="left">After  graduation I was hired by the Presiding Judge for the Third Judicial Circuit  Court in Salem, Oregon for a one year appointment as a judicial law clerk.  My duties included research, reviewing case  memorandums on motions and various investigations for seven judges in the  Circuit Court.  I would prepare  memorandums for the Judges as requested regarding specific questions that they  wanted researched on a wide variety of case types.  </p>
      <p align="left">Both  my time as a Deputy City Prosecutor and Judicial Law Clerk were unparalleled  educational experience that enhanced my love for the law and desire to help  people.</p>
      <p align="left">During  my career in Utah, I had several diverse clients and my main client was  Summerhays Music.  During this time, I  was appointed as a Judge Pro Tem for the Third Circuit Court in Murray,  Utah.  I was asked by Westminster  College, my alma mater, to be an associate professor in the School of Business  which I enjoyed doing for several years before moving to Elko.  During my years in Salt Lake City I was also  appointed to the bar committee that developed the mandatory Continuing Legal Education  requirements for all attorneys in Utah.</p>
      <p align="left">Over the course of my 32 years as a practicing attorney, 
        I have dealt with many areas of law.  My practice has
        given me a variety of both legal and trial experience.
        I have had cases in all areas of the law - criminal,
        juvenile, family, civil and even federal.
        In addition to my regular practice, I am one of the
        attorneys appointed by the Fourth and Seventh Judicial
        Districts to handle criminal and/or juvenile matters.
        I have also worked closely with the Committee Against
        Domestic Violence as an attorney to represent those who
        were referred by CADV. I also serve as an arbitrator for
        the Nevada State Bar in fee disputes.</p>      <p align="left"> Throughout the years, one specific case, which is
        still dear to my heart today, was when Judge Ames asked
        me to represent a young man and perform a guardianship
        which would allow him to qualify for an operation through
        the Shriner's Hospital which ultimately gave him complete
        use of his hands for the first time in his life.
        While working in Nevada, I have met so many wonderful people.
        It has been my honor to help those who are going through
    emotional or difficult times.</p></td>
