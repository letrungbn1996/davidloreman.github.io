      <td width="545" height="340"><p align="left">Throughout our 35 years together, David  has been  a loving husband and father.&nbsp; He has  always been, and is still, a strong and compassionate example, not only for our  two sons, Austin and Travis, but also for me.&nbsp;  He is the first to encourage me whether it is introducing me to the  excitement of Disneyland for the first time, encouraging me to continue my  education, or supporting me in my church activities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our marriage has truly become a partnership  in every way.<br />
        <br />
      David  has taken the necessary time and has the ability to show his love and support  for his family in so many different ways.&nbsp;  As our sons have grown, David often coached or assisted in coaching  their youth sports.&nbsp; Then when they were  in high school, we would travel together to their sporting or school activities  whenever possible.&nbsp; Besides supporting  them in sports, David would take every opportunity to express his love – for  example, we were “room parents” for Travis’ 4th grade class, where  we were responsible for organizing the games and refreshments.&nbsp;&nbsp; David took his obligation seriously and  would even arrange his schedule so that he could attend all the class  parties.&nbsp;&nbsp; His sons’ best interests were  always one of his top priorities.</p></td>

  <table width="917" border="0" align="center">
    <tr>
      <td width="911"><p align="left">Since  moving to Spring Creek, David also became very involved in various community  organizations.  Even this was often done  with his family in mind.  He has actively  worked in the Boy Scouts of America in various positions, which allowed  him to serve as a Cubmaster and Scoutmaster for his sons’ pack or troop.  Even now, he is working closely with Travis  as he is advancing toward his rank of Eagle Scout.  He has served with many organizations on behalf  of Elko County, from the Elko County Library Board to United Way, and continues  to actively work to help give back to and enhance our communities.</p>
        <p align="left"> David  and I have a wonderful family.&nbsp; Our older  son, Austin, who graduated from Spring Creek High School in 2003, just  graduated from Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Oregon.&nbsp;   Austin graduated from SOU with a degree in Criminal Justice. He recently married Chanell Krebs on 11-11-11 and started a business in Ashland, Oregon called the RedZone. Travis is graduating this year with a degree in Criminal Justice from Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Oregon. </p>
        <p align="left">During  our marriage, I have had the unique opportunity of working closely with David,  not only at home, but also at work.  We  have worked together professionally throughout our marriage which has created a  strong and very close bond between us.   Working with him, I have witnessed first hand his ability to show  firmness, compassion and fairness in dealing with people, no matter their age  or gender.  It is these very traits,  along with his loyalty and dedication to the community, that not only make him  a good attorney, but would make him the right choice for Justice of the Peace.<br />
            <br />
          I  am so fortunate to have a husband that is willing to give so much of his time  to our family, our home and our community.   He always has put his family, community and career ahead of  himself.  </p>
